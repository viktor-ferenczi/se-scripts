# Robotic Welder Arm Control v1

## Requirements
- Experimental mode enabled in the game (so the Programmable Block works)
- [Multigrid Projector client plugin](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415983416)

## How to test the script
- Subscribe to [this world](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2517203096)
- Create and enter the world
- Join the Testers faction
- Spawn to the medical room
- Enter the pilot seat at the top
- Recompile the program in the **Shipyard Projector**

## Remarks
- Tested only in single player in creative mode so far.
- Should work in multiplayer with simpler / less number of arms.
- The video shows an earlier iteration with more arms. The new code works better with less arms.
- The code may be refactored later to improve its usability in different worlds and for other use cases.
- Works best with skinny blueprints, primarily small block ones. Solid large block ships are blocking out the arms.
- Yes, you can build your own robot arms. The base must be in the "Welder Arms" group. Simpler is better.

*Enjoy*
