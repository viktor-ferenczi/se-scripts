[h1]Robotic Welder Arm Control v1[/h1]

[h2]Requirements[/h2]
[list]
[*] Experimental mode enabled in the game (so the Programmable Block works)
[*] [url=https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/multigrid-projector/]Multigrid Projector[/url] client plugin
[*] [url=https://github.com/sepluginloader/SpaceEngineersLauncher/]Plugin Loader[/url]
[/list]

The build is driven by an [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2517216899]in-game script[/url].

[h2]How to test the script[/h2]
[list]
[*] Subscribe to this world
[*] Create and enter the world
[*] Join the Testers faction
[*] Spawn to the medical room
[*] Enter the pilot seat at the top
[*] Recompile the program in the [b]Shipyard Projector[/b]
[/list]

[h2]Remarks[/h2]
[list]
[*] Tested only in single player in creative mode so far.
[*] Should work in multiplayer with simpler / less number of arms.
[*] The video shows an earlier iteration with more arms. The new code works better with less arms.
[*] The code may be refactored later to improve its usability in different worlds and for other use cases.
[*] Works best with skinny blueprints, primarily small block ones. Solid large block ships are blocking out the arms.
[*] Yes, you can build your own robot arms. The base must be in the "Welder Arms" group. Simpler is better.
